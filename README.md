Found yourself in an unfamiliar place? Don't know what the business you pass by every day actually does? Just curious about what's around you?

GeoTutor is a web app that uses a mobile device's gyroscope and geolocation functionalities for providing location services to the user. Based on the location and direction the device is facing, GeoTourist requests location details from the Google Maps API through by using StdLib functions to construct a location profile for the user. Interface is minimal and easy to use.

Simply point at a point of interest to find out what it's all about!
